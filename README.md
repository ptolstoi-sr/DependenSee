# Why `DependenSee` over 'X'

Current popular options are to either use NDepend, VS Architecture Explorer or Code Map. While these options are feature rich, they also has a licensing cost. If all you want is to see the dependency graph, and nothing else, it may be hard to justify the licensing cost. Then `DependenSee` is for you.

If you need to see the Type structure, relationships between your methods or types .etc. then you should use one of the options above instead. DependenSee is mean to be very simple, easy, straight forward to use and FREE! `DependenSee` does not intend to compete with the above. See [Limitations](#Limitations)

# Features

- Creates the dependency graph for your solution.
- Can only include or exclude certain namespaces so the result is not overwhelming or filled with noise.
- Can create HTML, XML, JSON and Graphviz outputs
- Can return output to `STDOUT` for further processing by other command line tools
- Returns errors and warnings to `STDERR`
 
For full docs run without any arguments
`DependenSee`


# Privacy and Security Note

In the output, the full path to project files is used as the unique identifier. So your file structure is exposed in the generated output. It attempts to only use the subdirectory structure, so an attempt is made to hide the full path, however it is possible these paths may include your username for example, if your project was located in the default VS path/repo clone location of `C:\Users\<username>\Repos\...`.

Keep this in mind and inspect the output if you're distributing the outputs from this tool.

# Limitations

- Currently only traverses `csproj` and `vbproj` files. No other file types are supported.
- No compile results are inspected. Only the project structure is used.
